<p style="margin: 20px"><em>Hello, my name's Aria and I lover baking. For me baking is a passion, I never have to bake things if I don't want to. I want baking to become a fun calming activity. I do not want it to be competitive sport. I want to bake just for the fun of it.My favorite part of baking it would be sharing it with other people and seeing the look of happiness and joy on their face.
The first thing I ever baked were brownies. I made them with my mom while we were baking I remember asking so many questions that are now very useful for me to know now.
